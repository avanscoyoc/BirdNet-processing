{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Extract Survey Length Metadata from Bird Audio files"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Background:\nOften acoustic surveys will include thousands of hours of audio files across many sites. Usually bird survey recording devices are programed to be synched to start and stop on pre-determined dates. However, due to issues with data recorders, such as battery issues, or unpredictable weather events, rain, damage, or human tampering, the actual survey start and end times might be different between sites. \n\nGoal: This code snippet loops through your audio file directory and extracts the earliest file start date and latest file end date to generate a dataframe of suvey start/end times by site. This dataframe can then be used to accounting for suvey problems or differences in survey effort in occupancy models for birds.
