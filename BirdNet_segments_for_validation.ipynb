    "Background: \n",
    "We collected acoustic data across 67 sites in the Mojave desert in 2023. Recordings were taken during the peak breeding season (May 20-28th). Acoustic Recordings were collected using Audiomoths deployed at each site for a minimum of 5 days. Audiomoths were programmed to record audio from 8pm to 9am each day to capture night calling birds and the dawn chorus. 4TB of acoustic recordings were collected and run through the BirdNet algorithm to produce a dataframe of species auto-classifications. We must validate the accuracy of these auto-classifications by listening to at least 50 calls segments for each species. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: \n",
    "To avoid scrolling to each timestamp in several thousand audio files across sites and species, here, I segment ~4 TB of bird call audio into 5-second clips and store clips in folders by species name for a quick manual validation."
